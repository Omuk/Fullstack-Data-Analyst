            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">My name is Brenda Museve. I am 13 years old in Grade six. I want to tell you a testimony about my life. Life with my parents was very good and pleasant together with siblings. My dad died in 2018 causing a lot of stress to us and our mother. We were rejected by close relatives and wanted to force us from our homes, were it not the intervention of the local government they would have succeeded. One day a well-wisher presented our case to daddy Justus and mummy Jane Amunga and by good luck we were accepted into Ushindi Children’s Home. Ushindi has offered a loving opportunity for new friends, a place to rejoice, provided education, balanced diet, clothes, and shelter. We thank Daddy and Mommy for the loving and caring for us. May God bless them, our sponsors, and staff. When I grow up, I would like to be a pilot.

Our shelter was falling apart as well. I remember the day when I was brought to Ushindi, I was sweeping the home compound. That day I realized good had decided to raise me from the least family to the ever great ‘Ushindi Children’s Home.’ Once I came here, they taught me a lot of things.

            <p class="card-text">My name is Nanzala Magdalene. I am 14 years old girl and brings me to say I am in STD8 pupil. Before I came to Ushindi, I passed through many difficulties. My lovely parents passed away long time ago. I was left with my siblings at home. My other relatives abandoned us, and we had to live in the house alone. That time I was five years as well as twin brothers 2 years and my sister 6 months old. My grandmother was old enough and struggled to feed us. We did not have enough clothes. We also had a house that was leaning on one side threatening to fall apart anytime. School was like a Goliathic trouble in my life. That time was like hell according to me. We did not go to church, and this therefore did not know God. Upon coming to Ushindi, Il learned how to know God. This has helped me spiritually. I would also thank Ushindi for introducing education in my life. My lovely sponsors have helped Mummy Jane Amunga in many ways that meet my needs. I would like to thank them for the food, clothes, shelter, great bedding, school uniform, school shoes, school bag and books. I would also like to thank Ushindi for introducing life skills in my life. I know how to hair dress people hair. This helps me to know what will help me in the coming generation. I also know how to knit things using strings. I also know how to sing and dance to the Lord. Thank you all for what you have done for me. God Bless you.

              </h5>
              <p class="card-text">My name is Jackson Ayuya born of a single parent (mother) from a humble family. Am the first born from our family of five, followed by three younger sisters and a late one. We were all brought up with my late grandmother since my mother suffered from psychological problem. Her condition couldn't make as know who truly our father was, we all persevered through hardship for survival. Later on we joined Ushindi children home as orphans, where we grew up in love and care as one family. "Thanks so much for mama Jane and the late papa Justus Amunga." [JAMES 1:27] They loved and cared us, brought us up spiritually and educationally ,taught us how to read and understand what God expects from us and took us to school to acquire knowledge through the help of sponsor's from African Orphans Outreach (A O O). I began my nursery school until completing my grade four level in high school where I excel to a tertiary college. I choose to join college because unfortunately I couldn't make for a university. After graduating for my course in electrical engineering, I went back home to stay with my mother since job opportunities were not available. I made a decision to help my mother regain her consciousness. Am greatly thankful to Almighty God and the doctors at large, through their help my mother's condition has been gradually showing up change as per the numbers she has been visiting for psych- clinic for attendance {Hebrew 6:10} By God's grace I decided to also help other people people who suffer from the same condition my mother was and are not awhere of the psycho-clinic. I do wish that God's will be unto me AMEN

              </h5>
              <p class="card-text">My name is Ruth Munabi. I am fourteen years old, and I am in grade seven. I was very young when my father abandoned me. My mother took care of me together with my siblings. The life was so hard that my mother was not able to make ends meet. I did not go to school because my mother had no money. I always got send home from school due to lack of fees or required materials. At home I started helping my mom while working to help raise money for basic needs. I started and kept praying to God for access to education and improved living conditions while my mom prayed for God’s protection of me and my siblings. Our prayers were answered when we were brought to Ushindi Children’s Home. Ushindi has helped me understand God better and learn how to worship him. Life now is good and enjoyable. I go to school, pray, and worship God and now I have the opportunity to succeed in life. As an adult I would like to be a musician and a lawyer. I will help other people the way Ushindi has helped me. That is my story and my testimony May God Bless you.

              <h5 class="card-title">A Testimony of Timothy Musonga an Alumni
              </h5>
              <p class="card-text">My name is Timothy Musonga, am an orphan. I lost my both parents at my little age of 3yrs. It was painful and sorrowful to loose the most beloved parents that age. My elder sister and I, we had no one to call dad nor mom. After the burial of my mother who followed after my father's burial in a short moment , my uncle took us into his home since we had no where to go to. We persevered through hardship since my uncle had no job nor source of income. In a life span he generally began to hate us naturally despite that we did nothing wrong. He asked his family to isolate from us since we are cursed . We wished our parents could be with us since we couldn't find love and care at that little age. One fine morning my aunt pay a visit to her brother's house and she was not pleased with how they mistreated us. We spoke to her and promised as she is going to take as to a children's home (orphanage). "Thanks to mama Jane Amaunga and the late Bishop Justus Amunga together with our sponsors from AOO at large.You loved and cared for us, gave us hope in life since we were hopeless, made us know God's expectations in life and also took us to school to acquire knowledge. They generally provided us all the basic need my almighty God blessings shower abundantly upon them." After my school, I decided to go back home and stay on my father's land since it was the only inheritance left for me. I was shocked to find that the property I was left with had already been sold to someone else by my uncle without my consent. I went ahead to those in authority to assist me in claiming it back but unfortunately everything was in vein. Instead my uncle made plans to bring distraction into my life. I began to suffer from headache till the time It developed to psychological problem. All-over a sudden I went mad for 3yrs, I met a good friend of mine, a brother too whom we grew up together at ushindi children home. He took me to a psychiatric clinic and I was attended on. By now sincerely speaking it's God's grace, I have been gradually changing and am greatly appreciating the good hand of God over my life. I will never late my past to ruin my future but its my prayer that God's will is going to lead me and I am going to have my on property in Jesus name.

First before I came at Ushindi my Life was very difficult because my father who used to provide for me everything had died leaving me with my mom. While alive, my parents would take me to school and meet my basic needs. After my dad’s death my mom struggled to meet with the needs forcing me to start working at an early age to afford food and education. I did not know God and had not time for him even if I had known him. Most of the time was spent working or looking for new jobs. One day after coming from working at someone’s farm, a man came to visit me in the home. The man was the Late Bishop Justus Amunga. Upon listening to my story, he took me to Ushindi Children’s Home where I have been ever since. When I grow Up, I would like to be an engineer. I want to thank mama Jane and daddy Justus Amunga. May the Almighty God bless Ushindi.
