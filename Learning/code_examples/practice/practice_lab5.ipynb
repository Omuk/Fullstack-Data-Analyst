practical machine learning pipelines, it’s common for the data to undergo multiple sequences of transformations before it feeds into a clustering algorithm. You learned about the importance of one of these transformation steps, feature scaling in an earlier lab. An equally important data transformation technique is dimensionality reduction, which reduces the number of features in the dataset by either removing or combining them.\n","Dimensionality reduction techniques help to address a problem with machine learning algorithms known as the curse of dimensionality.

This sparsity makes it difficult for algorithms to find data objects near one another in higher-dimensional space.\n","\n","###Dimensionality Reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n","PCA is one of many dimensionality reduction techniques.
